                        One of the most significant aspects of my career as a software engineer has been the opportunity to work on various projects throughout my high school years, university and in the free time. Through these projects I have gained proficiency in technologies such as JavaScript (React.js, Next.js) and CSS (SASS, Tailwind CSS).
